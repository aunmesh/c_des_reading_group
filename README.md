## 4 May

**Hyung Gun**
[Leveraging Photometric Consistency over Time for Sparsely Supervised Hand-Object Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13449.pdf)

> Uses photometric consistency to propagate annotations to un-annotated frames.

**Asim**
[Sim2real transfer learning for 3D human pose
estimation: motion to the rescue](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9454-sim2real-transfer-learning-for-3d-human-pose-estimation-motion-to-the-rescue.pdf)

> Proposes using optical flow and 2d keypoints as input for pose estimation networks. Since these inputs are not affected by photorealism , hence can be trained well using synthetic data, without suffering much performance drop for real data.



## 6 May

**Hyung Gun**
[Self-Supervised GANs via Auxiliary Rotation Loss](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11212.pdf)

> The role of self-supervision is to encourage the discriminator to learn meaningful feature repesentations which are not forgotten during training. The self-supervised GAN attains a similar performance to state-of-the-art conditional GAN.

**Asim**
[Cross-modal deep Variational hand pose estimation](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Spurr_Cross-Modal_Deep_Variational_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)

> Uses different decoders from jointly obtained multi modal data to a joint latent space and does reconstruction from that. Is able to train using instances where all modalities are not available but a few are. Using this latent space they can train for hand pose estimation.
